# MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model is built using PyTorch and includes visualization tools to track training progress.

## Project Structure

- `mnist_cnn.py`: Main implementation file containing the CNN model and training code
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages
- `mnist_cnn.pth`: Saved model weights (generated after training)

## Requirements

Install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required packages:
- torch>=2.0.0
- torchvision>=0.15.0
- matplotlib>=3.5.0
- numpy>=1.21.0

## Model Architecture

The CNN model consists of:
- 2 Convolutional layers (32 and 64 filters)
- Max Pooling layers
- 2 Fully Connected layers
- ReLU activation functions
- Dropout for regularization

## Training Process

### Epochs and Their Impact

An epoch represents one complete pass through the entire training dataset. The number of epochs significantly affects the model's performance:

1. **Too Few Epochs (1-2)**
   - Model might be underfitted
   - Lower accuracy on both training and test sets
   - Model won't have enough time to learn complex patterns

2. **Optimal Epochs (5-10)**
   - Good balance between training time and performance
   - Typically achieves 98-99% accuracy on MNIST
   - Sufficient time to learn important features

3. **Too Many Epochs (20+)**
   - Risk of overfitting
   - Model might memorize training data
   - Wasted computational resources
   - Potential decrease in test accuracy

### Learning Curves

The code includes visualization of learning curves that show:
- Training loss over epochs
- Training accuracy over epochs
- Test accuracy over epochs

These curves help determine the optimal number of epochs by showing:
- When the model plateaus
- If overfitting is occurring
- The learning rate of the model

## Usage

1. Run the training:
```bash
python mnist_cnn.py
```

2. To modify the number of epochs, change the `epochs` parameter in `mnist_cnn.py`:
```python
train_losses, train_accs, test_accs = train(epochs=5)  # Change number here
```

## Output

The program will:
1. Download and preprocess the MNIST dataset
2. Train the model for the specified number of epochs
3. Display training progress and statistics
4. Show learning curves
5. Visualize sample predictions
6. Save the trained model

## Model Performance

The model's performance can be monitored through:
- Training loss
- Training accuracy
- Test accuracy
- Learning curves
- Sample predictions visualization

2. **Epoch 2:**
   - Training Loss: 0.0021
   - Training Accuracy: 98.43%
   - Test Accuracy: 98.59%

3. **Epoch 3:**
   - Training Loss: 0.0016

   - Test Accuracy: 99.19%

4. **Epoch 4:**
   - Training Loss: 0.0011
   - Training Accuracy: 99.07%
   - Test Accuracy: 99.09%

5. **Epoch 5:**
   - Training Loss: 0.0014
   - Training Accuracy: 99.20%
   - Test Accuracy: 99.00%

#### Analysis:
- The model shows rapid improvement in the first epoch, reaching 95% training accuracy
- By epoch 3, the model achieves over 99% test accuracy
- The training loss consistently decreases, showing good learning progress
- The model maintains stable performance in later epochs
- Final test accuracy of 99% demonstrates excellent performance

#### Key Observations:
1. **Early Learning:**
   - Significant improvement in first epoch
   - Quick convergence to high accuracy

2. **Stability:**
   - Consistent performance across epochs 3-5
   - Small fluctuations in test accuracy (98.59% - 99.19%)

3. **Overfitting Check:**
   - Training accuracy (99.20%) and test accuracy (99.00%) are close
   - Suggests good generalization without overfitting

## Best Practices

1. **Choosing Epochs:**
   - Start with 5 epochs
   - Monitor learning curves
   - Stop when test accuracy plateaus
   - Watch for signs of overfitting

2. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Use test accuracy as the main metric
   - Compare training and test accuracy
   - Check sample predictions
   - Monitor learning curves

3. **Saving Results:**
   - Model weights are saved as 'mnist_cnn.pth'
   - Learning curves are displayed during training
   - Sample predictions are visualized

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
1. **CUDA/GPU Issues:**
   - The code automatically uses GPU if available
   - Falls back to CPU if GPU is not available

2. **Memory Issues:**
   - Reduce batch size if needed
   - Monitor GPU memory usage

3. **Training Issues:**
   - Adjust learning rate if training is unstable
   - Modify number of epochs based on learning curves
   - Check for overfitting/underfitting
